            <h2>Context/Content</h2>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about showing people around the world about technology that already exists and what technology will be like in the future. Students will be choosing a topic that they are interested in and spend the rest of the year step by step by working toward their MVP (minimum viable product) of their website that introduces their topics. The process of this project is to gather information, brainstorming future ideas, learning the selected tool, and creating the final product and showing off the project in an EXPO (when judges and students come to see our project). The purpose of this blog is to show a timeline of my process throughout the beginning to the end of the school year while creating this website. 
            </p>
            <p>For my project, I am making a website about designing clothes using HTML, CSS, and Github. During the process of creating my website, a blog entry came along with it. It's a journal about the beginning, middle, and end of creating my website. It’s about the technology that has been in the world of designing clothes, and brainstorming some of the possible future ideas of designing clothes. During the process I created Part A, Part B, Future Idea, Wireframe,MVP, and learned TailWind CSS which is all included in my Blog.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Over the course of making this website, I faced several challenges. I didn't know how to link websites, create space between two components(Grid System), and change color from black/white to colorful when you hover for an image(Tailwind). Throughout trying different things I finally found the  solution to each problem. To link different HTML pages I have to Start with <code>&lt;a class="nav-link"&gt;</code>. Then inside the  <code>&lt;href="#">...<&gt; </code>add your other html page to make it link. To create space between two components I need to add <code>&lt;mt&gt;</code>(Margin Top) which can separate the two things. To change color from black/white to colorful when you hover you have to Instead of <code>&lt;div class=“grayscale”&gt; </code> I have to put it as, <code>&lt;div class=”grayscale hover:grayscale-0”&gt;</code>
               </p>
               <P>
                   Throughout the process of making the website I learn and gain many takeaways. I learn to read documents carefully. I have to make sure to read the code correctly and double check the code, and read more before putting in the code. I learn how to use the inspector tool where I can use the tool to find what’s wrong with the code and fix it. Also, try different html/css to change or fix codes without actually affecting the website. Furthermore, I learn about Time management where I can plan out what part I can do each day on the project so I won’t stress out and run out of time. These are the takeaways I had thought of that can be useful to my future. 
                   My next step is to using all of the knowledge I learn this years and bring it to 11th grade with me
